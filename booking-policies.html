      <p class="text">Please note that your tattoo appointment is not confirmed until we have settled on a date/time and I've received a screenshot of the deposit paid to lock in your booking. 
        I will always send a follow up email letting you know that your tattoo appointment has now been confirmed.
        <br><br>
        I open my books roughly every 3 months and keep them open for one week to allow everyone enough time to send in their submission.
        I respond to all new submissions via email within one week to start the booking process and then I close my books again. Please note that I don't check my emails outside 
        of these booking windows to allow for a better work/life balance so please contact Chalice Tattoo Co via phone call (07) 3191 9820 if you need an immediate response from me.
      </p>
      <h4 class="headings">𝗗𝗘𝗣𝗢𝗦𝗜𝗧𝗦</h4>
      <p class="text">
        A $100 deposit will be collected for each booking made, this amount comes off the total on the day.
        <br><br>
        Once I've sent you my deposit information, the deposit will need to be paid within 72 hours to secure that date/time. 
        If I don't receive a screenshot of the deposit paid within this time frame, your booking will be automatically deleted from my system and the prior agreed upon date 
        will need to be renegotiated before a deposit can be paid.
      </p>
      <h4 class="headings">𝗥𝗘𝗦𝗖𝗛𝗘𝗗𝗨𝗟𝗘𝗦</h4>
      <p class="text">
        If you need to reschedule your booking, please contact me via Instagram only more than 48 hours before your appointment time. Failure to do so within this time 
        frame will forfeit your deposit and a second deposit will be required to secure a new date.
        <br><br>
        Please note that only 2 reschedules are honoured with your original deposit - if for whatever reason you need to reschedule a 3rd time, 
        a new deposit will be required to lock in a new date.
        <br><br>
        As I am booked out at least 3 months in advance, please be aware that if you need to reschedule - I will always do my best to find you a date 
        ASAP but to keep things fair, it's highly likely your new date will be months out from your original.
      </p>

        <br>
        Full day bookings consist of 6 hours of tattooing time charged at $1100. If you'd like to book a full day, please be aware that I have a policy which requires a minimum spend of $700. 
        This means that if you tap out early or cannot complete the 6 hour session, a minimum payment of $700 will need to be paid at the end of the session and the deposit for that session will be 
        put towards a second session to finish your tattoo. If this concerns you please let me know as we can easily negotiate doing your tattoo over several smaller sessions.
        <br><br>
        Thank you for reading my booking policies!
        If you have any questions about anything, please let me know as I'm always happy to clarify.
        I'm looking forward to working with you!
